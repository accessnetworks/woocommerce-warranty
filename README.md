## Easily set up warranties for products

When setting up your products, easily assign warranties to the product or variation directly from the edit product screens. Easily define warranty or return time periods, give it a price, and update/save your product. Warranties are tied directly to the product themselves – when the warranty expires, so does the ability for the user to request a warranty, return, or exchange.
